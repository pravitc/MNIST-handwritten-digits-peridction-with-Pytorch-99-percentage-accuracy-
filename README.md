**Code Requirements**  
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.  
**Description**  
MNIST is the famous hand written datasets. Using neural network we can predict the hand written images very well. For this project I have used the convolutional neural network with two convolution layer and two maxpool layers. The model will take images of size 28*28. Here I have used most famous pytorch fraamework.
